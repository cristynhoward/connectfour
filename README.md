# Connect 4

This repository contains the code for the connect four twitter bot.

## Acknowledgments

The Connect 4 Twitter bot was imagined & developed by Cristyn Howard.

The gameplay is that of the classic game Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)), the origins of which are unclear.

The name "Connect Four", and the classic plastic board from which the bot's emoji output is derived, are trademarks of Hasbro Inc. Copies of the game are available for purchase [here](https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/product/connect-4-game:80FB5BCA-5056-9047-F5F4-5EB5DF88DAF4).

## How to Play

1. START: mention @BotConnectFour in a new tweet, type the word "new" followed by a space, & then mention the user you want to play a game with.

2. PLAY: on your turn (indicated by a "next" beside your name), reply to the board with the number of the column you want to put your piece in.

3. WIN: when you get 4 in a row!
